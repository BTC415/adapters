  description:
    'Mobilian is a blockchain-based network that powers up an ecosystem dedicated to secure autonomous vehicles. The robust security features Mobilian offers will be adequate to secure vehicle AI controls, data storage, along with other decentralized platforms that will be created on the same network. As data is vital for AI-driven vehicles, a reliable blockchain-based data storage will help guarantee the efficiency of automated cars. Mobilian encourages decentralization within the autonomous automotive industry. They offer a safe environment where automakers and innovators can practice healthy exchange of knowledge regarding driverless car development. With collaboration and transparency among driverless car manufacturers, AI-driven cars can hit the public roads earlier. In the future, they aim to develop Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) applications to see all driverless cars offering a ride on the network. Mobilian leverages the power of blockchain to support the autonomous vehicle industry from securing the vehicleâ€™s AI control panel to powering a robust interactive ecosystem.',
