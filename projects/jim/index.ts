  description:
    'Jim is an advanced AI Bot, used to generate a response to any given post. The Jim Bot is cross platform, currently operating on Twitter, Telegram and soon to be launched on Discord. It embodies the spirit of not just Crypto Twitter but sprawls far into the different aspects of Web2 including discussions on Politics, Sports, Life and even Camaraderie. Jim represents the presence of a helpful AI always by your side to respond for you with great intellect at a moments notice. The team intends to launch many personalities of the Bot intended to be used in different scenarios, trained in different specialities to capture every niche market and have every Bot behave differently and respond in a certain manner to push the limits of the AI. The project was born out of a need for a large community of people that love having a good time with their community. Devs that were previously well versed with Twitter bots came together the new phenomenon that could soon be used across platform on all social networks and apps. The project intends to challenge the boundaries of AI. First will be improvement of the bot that we already have. The road map is to increase the functionality to all social platforms. Add other token features including Burn as well as the Roast 2 Earn feature while would include earning $jim token which sending out a response. Other than holders being able to support the project and the innovation behind the AI. They can join in the ever-lasting Meme culture of CT. The team also intends to burn tokens per tweet (summoning of the bot). A certain amount of jim tokens will be burnt per trigger of the bot, leading to the token being deflationary. These tokens would be burn monthly or bi-monthly."',
