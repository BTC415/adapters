  description:
    'PureFi is the only DeFi AML protocol for cryptocurrency onboarding. It aims to provide a full-cycle solution for cryptoasset analytics and AML/KYC procedures on the DeFi market. PureFi will connect to the AML providers through oracles and provide cryptoassets analytics in order to protect liquidity pool users and honest market players from “dirty money” risks. For example the liquidity pool user will be able to avoid the risk of getting an illegal money trail using the VC certificate with his full-fledged AML/KYC data. The protocol will include a wide range of risk indicators to liquidity pools users and DEXs, reporting suspicious activity with enhanced due diligence. Moreover, the risk scoring methodology applied by PureFi can be fully customizable through DAO voting to fit the further regulation requirements.',
