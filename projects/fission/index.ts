  description:
    "Fission builds open source protocols and managed solutions that empower developers to construct scalable and secure software applications. Because the app is running on the user's computer, developers can focus on finding new users and adding new features, rather than having to learn DevOps or server scaling. People using apps create a secure identity in their browsers. Every Fission account is linked to a file system, available in any browser. Much like an open source iCloud, users give permissions to apps, and can access their files from anywhere. Users can browse their file system, both public and private, and mix and match which apps they use, just like they're used to with mobile and desktop apps.",
