  description:
    "The TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications that run completely serverless inside of contributor's compute nodes. The TEA Project builds upon web3 technologies like blockchain as well as trusted hardware to unlock a decentralized compute layer that runs on par with traditional cloud apps. TEA leverages hardware security modules (HSM) within decentralized compute nodes to ensure a secure app execution environment. The TEA Project's state machine runs decentralized and continuously using time as a root of trust to order transactions. The TEA Project aims to become an ideal entry point for developers looking to migrate from web2 to web3.",
