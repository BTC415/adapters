  description:
    "Relative Finance is building cross-sector dApps for derivatives and skill-based wagering across SocialFi, DeFi, and GameFi. Their first product offering provides market participants with exposure to the 'relative' strength between two assets through the creation of Relative Strength Derivatives (RSDs) in the form of a binary wager. RSDs provide participants with the ability to speculate on the difference in performance between two assets, rather than the absolute performance of a single asset. Relative uses TradingView technology to display price data on charts. Powered by robust technologies across browser, desktop and mobile apps, the platform provides unparalleled access to live data e.g. BTC USD chart, the latest news, financial reports, Stock screener and Economic calendar.",
