  description:
    'The Oasis Network is a Layer 1 decentralized blockchain network designed to be uniquely scalable, privacy-first and versatile. The Network has two main architectural components, the consensus layer and the ParaTime layer. The consensus layer is a scalable, high-throughput, secure, proof-of-stake consensus run by a decentralized set of validator nodes. The ParaTime layer hosts many parallel runtimes (ParaTimes), each representing a replicated compute environment with shared state.',
