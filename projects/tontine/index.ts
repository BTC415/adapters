    'Tontine gamifies retention for web3 dApps with onchain streaks. Any project can sponsor a Tontine to improve their retention and reduce their CAC. After they invite users to join their Tontine, the users must complete an action every day (e.g. play a match of BR1:Infinite, post to Solarplex, etc). The last person to maintain the daily streak wins the entire prize pool',
