  description:
    "RobotEra is an expansive, immersive gaming platform combining play-to-earn gaming with NFT-based unique digital assets and metaverse world-building. Players take control of robot companions with a goal of rebuilding the destroyed planet of Taro using in-game tools requiring zero coding knowledge.In RobotEra, players use $TARO to passively generate income through activities like quests, community events, and staking. They can also monetize their assets by selling billboard space or individual structures on the open market. Additionally, players can charge ticket admission to events, concerts, and museums within the game, as well as sell plots of land or individual structures.Players will also be able to stake their tokens to vote on the future direction of RobotEra's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as well as earn passive yield. In 2023, the project plans to integrate virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) into the game.",
