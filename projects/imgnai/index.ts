    'ImgnAI turns your words into images using Artificial Intelligence. ImgnAI’s flagship product is “Nai” - an AI bot that turns anything you write into an anime, 3D, or hyper-realistic image. Nai is free to use now, but plans for a paid version, called Nai Premium, are in the works. Nai Premium users will be able to access exclusive art styles and models, remove watermarks, upscale and render their images in 4K, and mint them to NFTs.',
