  description:
    'Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network with a strong focus on Superintelligence. It will include a new distribution model, economics, improved ranking and some superintelligent abilities. We think of a Bostrom as a canary network the same way that Kusama relates to Polkadot. The knowledge graph of Bostrom tends to be a bootstrap hub for domain specific networks of Cyber. The network will work as a test bed for IKP communications and different experiments. Consider Bostrom as a network with high risks but which have market value. The key differences within the Cyber network are being discussed here. The launch of the Bostrom network is the inception of the ecosystem.',
