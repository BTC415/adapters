  description:
    'Zion is a decentralized platform built using DIDâ€™s, ION & the Bitcoin Lightning Network. It is designed to facilitate the free, open flow of content and payments between creators and their audiences at scale. Their solution is using a peer-to-peer distributed network of Decentralized Web Nodes to solve the problem of centralized content networks. This gives creators ownership of their data without having to capitulate to the requirements of third parties or a blockchain. This system must be built for Web5 interoperability so people are no longer gated by what applications they can use with their data. Additionally, through the use of Distributed Data Networks, the single points of failures aggregators and third party services create will cease to exist. Traditional asymmetric cryptography will ensure data is secure and stops mass data theft. With Decentralized Identifiers people can verify who they are communicating with on the web, and encryption with cyptographic signatures to chat.',
