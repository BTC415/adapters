  description:
    'SelfKey is a blockchain-based identity platform. The technology provides individuals, companies, exchanges, fintech startups, and banks - with a platform to manage identity data (oftentimes KYC). The core team has worked on decentralized identity since 2014 across companies such as Standard Chartered Bank, Bitmax exchange, EQIBank, and GSR. The SelfKey wallet (SelfKey.org/selfkey-wallet) is a free, open-source, non-custodial wallet that allows users to securely store and transmit both digital assets, and their digital identity. Users can interact in the SelfKey marketplace - to ‘one-click’ apply for products such as a real-world bank account or company incorporation and pay with KEY. A traditional KYC process is costly, and oftentimes unsafe - as data is stored in centralized databases. SelfKey leverages a decentralized approach and cryptographic technologies with the goal of dramatically lower the cost, improve the security, and customer experience of an identity interaction. SelfKey aims to revolutionize the KYC on-boarding process and remain true to the ethos of Self Sovereign Identity - that each individual should be able to own and control their identity.',
