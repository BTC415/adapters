  description:
    'GPU Audio, INC (founded in Switzerland as Braingines SA) is a technology startup that bridges the world of GPU innovation with professional audio, through the world’s first fully capable solution for audio processing over GPU. GPU Audio’s novel approach allows for DSP (digital signal processing) to be offloaded onto the parallel processing architecture of GPUs at 1ms latency round-trip, allowing for truly next-gen features such as: limitless DSP plugin instances, remote computing and wireless/cloud processing, continuous audio rendering (no more exporting audio), and instantaneous results. Beginning with VST3 and AU functionality, we are redesigning the way DSP is handled so that developers and end-users alike can benefit immediately from the incredible power of GPUs to both enhance their existing products, and create the plugins and software of their dreams. Our mission is to provide a truly next-gen, qualitative level of performance for pro audio, and become the new standard of audio processing for the digital future across numerous verticals.',
