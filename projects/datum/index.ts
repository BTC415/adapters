  description:
    "Datum is a decentralized and distributed data store where structured data can be safely stored and traded between the data generator (normal users) and any party interested in purchasing such data, but only under user's terms. Developed with blockchain technology, it allows for secure, private, and anonymous storage of data. In order to facilitate such an exchange, the Datum token (DAT) serves as a medium. Datum's vision is to return the power of decision back to data generators/users on how they want third parties to utilize their data. In other words, they aim to democratize the usage and accessibility of structured data, and therefore establish a transparent data marketplace where all members within the ecosystem (sellers, buyers, storage node providers, society as a whole) can benefit from it.",
