    'Gateway is a decentralized protocol for creating, consuming, and displaying verifiable credentials to serve as a basis for an interconnected web and portable reputation. Applications and individuals using Gateway can natively issue custom credentials based on whatever parameters they decide - whether it be on their application, off-chain from sources like Twitter, or even based on on-chain conditions. Others can then consume this information to build more custom credentials, scoring models, or access points.',
