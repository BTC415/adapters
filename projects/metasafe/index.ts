  description:
    'The MetaSafe platform is a decentralized storage and peer-to-peer network that enables anyone with an Internet connection to store their information securely from any computing device and privately retrieve it on demand or share it at will. Due to its decentralized nature, data is virtually hackproof and not subject to any commercial exploitation. To achieve this, MetaSafe uses blockchain technology, the same technology that safeguards cryptocurrencies but with some unique enhancements. These enhancements include proof-of-stake, proof-of-bandwidth, and proof-of-storage consensus protocols, a utility token to incentivize network build-out and track value exchange, and finally the ease of running the validation nodes on millions of standard routers. Modern routers with powerful processors are an under-utilized piece of hardware in most homes and the always-on, alwaysconnected nature of these devices make them a perfect system for running MetaSafe.',
