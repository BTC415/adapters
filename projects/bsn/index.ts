    'The Blockchain-based Service Network is a cross-cloud, cross-portal, and cross-framework global infrastructure network used to deploy and operate all types of blockchain applications. BSN aims to change the existing problem of the high cost of developing and deploying blockchain applications by providing public blockchain resource environments to developers, just like the internet, thus greatly reducing costs associated with the development, deployment, operations, maintenance and regulation of blockchain applications and, thereby, accelerating the development and universal adaptation of blockchain technology.',
