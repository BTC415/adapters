  description:
    'Inco Network is an EVM Layer-1, utilizing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable composable and operable confidential states. Their fhEVM (FHE + EVM) makes it possible to write private smart contracts and perform computations on top of encrypted data without requiring its decryption. This innovation unlocks a wide range use cases with confidentiality components, such as card games, DID, private voting, dark pools, etc.',
