  description:
    "The ROVI is one of the most innovative power-bases ever created. Unlike anything that has come before, the ROVI utilizes a unique chassis configuration that creates MORE stability with LESS overall width. It's a simple, but remarkable breakthrough in power wheelchair design, and when paired with our powerful 4-pole motors and patented ARC Suspension, the result is truly noteworthy.",
