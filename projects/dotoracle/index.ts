  description:
    'DotOracle is a decentralized bridge on Casper Network and a cross-chain bridge supported by EVM chains and non-EVM chains. Their main products: - Multichain bridge: Fast, Affordable, and Secure way of moving liquidity between EVM, non-EVM (Near, Solana), and L2 blockchains. - Decentralized oracle: It is an advanced decentralized data feeding protocol offering multiple, real-time data sources with complementarity to and synergy with off-chain workers. - Multichain NFT bridge: The bridge combines high scalability with superior security. It works by creating wrapped NFTs that preserve the original assetsâ€™ metadata without duplicating the assets themselves. The original NFTs are safely stored in custody and can be restituted to the holder if needed. - Privacy-preserving bridge: We support privacy preservation for users when bridging stablecoins from other chains to Casper.',
