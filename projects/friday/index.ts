  description:
    'OwnFriday is developing a Mobile App and Protocol that empower users to repossess their most valuable web2 data, and then benefit from it directly in web3 by sharing it directly with creators and enterprises â€” without ever giving up ownership or control. Their mobile consumer app and protocol retrieves their web2 data for them, encrypts it on their device, and represents that data on-chain via non-transferable cNFTs on Solana. Eventually, users will be able to monetize that data as part of a virtual consortium. To deliver value to users right away, they have developed a personalized AI concierge, trained to users personal taste, leveraging that data.',
