    'Element is a Matrix-based end-to-end encrypted communications platform. Itâ€™s decentralised so that users can be digitally sovereign (own and control their own data). Element can be self-hosted, or through a hosting service such as Element Matrix Services. Element operates on the open Matrix network to provide interoperability between other messenger and collaboration apps.',
