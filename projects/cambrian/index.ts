  description:
    'Cambrian Protocol is a blockchain agnostic Ethereum dApp that enables resource allocation through conditional tokens. These tokens are redeemable for real funds when their conditions are met. This allows digital organizations, like DAOs and protocols, to fund projects, issue grants, hire employees, coordinate with each other, and even contract centralized entities without ever needing to trust that their funds are being spent properly.',
