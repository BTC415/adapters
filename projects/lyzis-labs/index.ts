  description:
    'Lyzis Labs is an incentive-driven and democratic protocol built upon a decentralized online marketplace based on blockchain technology. The major proposal of the protocol, Lyzis Marketplace, allows two or more people to be securely connected in a decentralized way without going through a Trusted Third Party (TTP) to perform physical asset exchanges while primarily providing transparent and fully protected data storage. Such approach may give rise to a permissionless, secure and transparent business system where users are empowered by decision-making and can simultaneously follow personal and collective interests.',
