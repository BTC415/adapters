  description:
    'Fishcoin is a blockchain based traceability and data ecosystem designed specifically for the global seafood industry. It creates an incentive for data capture in various forms beginning with key data elements captured and communicated by fishermen and fish farmers at the point of harvest for the purpose of traceability. By addressing the critical incentive problem we are effectively creating an ecosystem for rewarding fishermen and supply chain intermediaries through micro- transactions, creating a virtuous cycle (carrot) for sustainable practices that extends beyond government mandates (stick) for traceability. The Fishcoin ecosystem is not a single application, but a series of decentralized open source tools designed to integrate with those used by the industry. By creating the appropriate reward structure for data capture along with an interoperable architecture, the Fishcoin ecosystem will allow for makers of third party tools such as IoT sensors and other data inputs to participate in the ecosystem and be rewarded accordingly. This will increase the velocity of data through supply chains and allow buyers to have a better understanding of the actual metrics that impact safety and quality.',
