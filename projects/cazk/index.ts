    'Via the protocol, user can create proofs of inclusion or exclusion, which allows them to hide more information whilst asserting to be part of some group. The ability to prove exclusion is especially useful as it allows assertion such as "I am not part of this group and do not satisfy this set of conditions" whilst not revealing exactly what group or what properties the prover has when proving.',
