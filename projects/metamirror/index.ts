    "MetaMirror is specializing in Decentralized Identity (DID), focused on empowering individuals with control over their personal data. Their solution utilizes the privacy-preserving blockchain infrastructure of Oasis Network to facilitate ethical data monetization, ensuring the privacy of users.Their process begins with users tokenizing their Web2 and Web3 data into confidential personal data assets. These assets are then managed by a smart DID, known as AI Buddy. By analyzing the user's identity properties, such as demographics and preferences, AI Buddy identifies earning opportunities, such as paid ads and surveys, and offers data-driven services to generate income for the user.",
