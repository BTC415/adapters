  description:
    "Blast is Bware Labs' API provider platform that aims to solve Web 3 infrastructure issues related to reliability and latency, by employing geographically distributed third-party nodes. Blast offers a multi-region architecture that, along with a series of clustering and geo-location mechanisms, ensures optimal routing of user requests to the closest point of presence relative to where a call is generated from. Moreover, using third-party nodes scattered all over the world, Blast ensures the decentralization of the underlying blockchain infrastructures thus reducing down-time and increasing reliability. Third-party Node Providers that support the platform by registering their full nodes and fulfilling query requests are included in an incentivization mechanism that allows them to receive a share of the funds coming into the platform via subscription plan fees. Additionally, all provider nodes have the option to create Staking Pools where they can stake INFRA Tokens and receive an APY in order to increase their revenue for hosting full nodes on Blast supported blockchains.",
