  description:
    'AdHash protocol is a self-hosted advertising platform which allows publishers and advertisers to serve ads, manage campaigns, and collect performance data on premise. Data flows directly between publishers and advertisers, so the company is not an intermediary in the process. This eliminates the need for trust and third-party verification platforms. It enables daily payment reconciliations, along with accurate real-time data, immediate control, and complete data ownership.AdHash creates unique identifiers for every ad, called ad hashes and they store them on the blockchain, creating an immutable public record of all ads and the advertisers behind them.',
