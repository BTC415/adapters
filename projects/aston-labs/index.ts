    "Aston Labs are building a decentralized energy & infrastructure network. The Aston Network includes physical asset & infrastructure builders, developers, and financiers from around the world who are working to build as much carbon free infrastructure as possible, as quickly as possible. Network participants use Aston's platform, partners, & prime development sites to discover, plan, underwrite and finance new and expanding infrastructure projects. Network participants can: 1. Buy a piece of the network and hold. 2. Turn their illiquid infrastructure ownership into tradable securities. 3. Get paid for growing or improving the network. 4. Build their stake in the Aston Network the more value they add. The Aston Token is the equivalent of a share in the Aston Network. The Aston Tokens are owned by Aston Network participants who work to grow the value of the Aston Network.",
