  description:
    "Neural Radiance Fields is a token inspired by groundbreaking new technology that allows users to generate high-quality, interactive 3D environments from simple 2D inputs, and then create photorealistic videos as if they were shot from a drone or handheld gimbal. Because it's such a new development, there really was no user-friendly way to take advantage of this amazing technology. But that's what we hope to change. We're developing an easy and convenient way for all users to leverage this technology to create unique and engaging videos and renders for many different purposes using both our Telegram bot and web platform.",
