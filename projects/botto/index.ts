  description:
    "Botto is a decentralized autonomous artist governed by a growing community. Botto launched on October 8th, 2021. Botto creates 350 art pieces a week and garners community preference through a voting mechanism. Votes represent individual preferences on what a participant considers to be aesthetically pleasing art. Collectively, votes are used as feedback for Botto's art engine - dictating what direction Botto should take its next series of art pieces. Over time, Botto creates art guided and governed by the community.",
