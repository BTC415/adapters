  description:
    'A startup offering a new method for human-verified data processing at scale. Rapidata solves a fundamental problem faced by the modern AI industry. AI tools and systems, like ChatGPT, autonomous driving or magic erase, rely on massive amounts of data and the secret of the industry is that this data needs to be filtered, annotated and validated by enormous amounts of repetitive human labor in low cost countries. This is slow, expensive, and most of all, not scalable. Rapidata solves this by not relying on a fixed workforce, instead they have an existing network of Millions of People around the world that they can access through the same technology as digital ads. This allows them to offer 1000x faster human-verified data processing at scale, while being more affordable than the competition.',
