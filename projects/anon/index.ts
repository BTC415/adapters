    'Our mission is to be the commercial infrastructure powering the automated internet. Anon builds authentication and access management infrastructure that enables developers to securely request, authenticate, and integrate with the most popular sites on the internet. Developers in our beta program are using Anon’s toolkit to supercharge their apps, connecting them to the rest of the internet and taking actions on behalf of users safely and securely. This future vision — an internet where user actions are automated and “API-ified” — is the automated internet, and Anon is the identity layer that makes it possible.',
