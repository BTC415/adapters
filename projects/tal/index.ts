  description:
    'Trustless Autonomous Layer (TAL) is a groundbreaking initiative that ushers in a new era of decentralized AI model results verification on the Solana Blockchain. At TAL, they aim to push the boundaries of conventional AI computations, ushering in an era of provable, transparent on-chain AI results. They are leveraging the power of the Solana Blockchain and a network of oracles to ensure consensus-based, reliable AI results that users can trust implicitly. As they create this innovative platform, they are also unlocking new avenues for AI monetization. Within the TAL network, programs pay for each AI result generated, incentivizing miners with $TAL tokens for their contributions, and offering AI engineers royalties each time their model is used.',
