  description:
    'Nina is a self-publishing protocol for musicians. The decentralized file-distribution, tokenized ownership, and transparent royalty payments aims to circumvent the exploitative status-quo of the music industry. Nina empowers musicians, labels and archives to connect directly with their fans, establish new communities, and create context-rich experiences with unparalleled depth. On Nina, listeners are already discovering, curating and sharing music in an entirely new way.',
