  description:
    'MurAll is a collaborative canvas allowing artists worldwide to paint onto an ever evolving piece of art. This is a first of its kind project made possible by the use of blockchain technology, allowing anyone anywhere in the world to draw whatever they like without restrictions on what they can draw. MurAll requires a digital token called PAINT to enable artists to draw onto the canvas. Each PAINT token can draw 2 pixels and just like real life paint, it can only be used to draw once. If is has been used it canâ€™t be taken off of the wall and reused! With only a finite amount of PAINT available globally (there is only enough PAINT to cover the canvas 21,000 times), it is a commodity which encourages artists to produce work they are passionate about as the more PAINT that is used, the less is available.',
